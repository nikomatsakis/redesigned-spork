# ðŸ’– Be kind and considerate

> You don't have to agree with everyone, but you should always be kind and considerate.

Pushing Rust forward is already a tough task, being kind and avoiding conflicts prevents us from making it even harder.

Rust is being built and used by different people from around the globe, everyone got a personal opinion when it comes to what is the best for the language, so disagreements are inevitable.

When you disagree with someone, remember to:

1. Respect the other person and their opinion, as they are also trying to help.
2. Be willingful to listen to ideas and change your mind when necessary.
3. Be comprehensive when other decision is taken, even if it's not what you expected.

Being rude and disrespectful usually tears people apart, which is bad for Rust itself, as collaboration is key in open-source development.
